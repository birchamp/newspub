# newpub-rs: Publisher parity checklist

This is the single source of truth for feature parity with Microsoft Publisher (Microsoft 365).
The goal is behavioural parity. We reproduce what Publisher does, never its code, assets, or templates.

**Rules**
- An item is checked (`[x]`) only when every journey listed for it passes in CI on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
  The first items were checked from CI run 37839317947 (commit addfc94), whose job logs show 93/97 journeys passing on all three OSes;
  the failing set (J-AX-003, J-BB-003, J-BB-004, UI-SH-007) is the same on every OS. The remaining P0–P2 items were checked
  from CI run 37842573100 (commit bb529dc): 100/100 journeys pass on macOS, Windows, and Linux. The P3 items were
  checked from CI run 37854377656 (commit 6c64ad8): 116/116 journeys pass on all three OSes.
- Journeys are written by the lead **before** an item is dispatched. The implementing agent never edits them.
- Priorities: **P0** means newpub is unusable without it. **P1** means everyday work needs it.
  **P2** covers professional and occasional workflows. **P3** is rare, legacy, or research.
- Target users (assumed until told otherwise; see ARCHITECTURE.md §0): small organisations, schools, and
  churches that produce newsletters, bulletins, flyers, and folded booklets and print them in-house or at a print shop.
  Their workflows decide what goes into P0 and P1.
- Journey IDs (`J-…`) refer to files in `journeys/scripts/<ID>.yaml`. A `UI-…` journey drives the real egui app through AccessKit.
- The dashboard parses the tables below. Keep the column layout unchanged: `| ID | P | Feature | Journeys | Done |`.
