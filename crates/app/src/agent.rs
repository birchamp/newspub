//! The desktop app as an MCP host (AG-02): `newpub --agent` serves the protocol on stdin/stdout while the window
//! shows the publication, so a person watches an agent work and can take over at any time. The tools and their
//! dispatch live in `newpub-agent`; this file keeps the view in step and protects the person's unsaved work.
